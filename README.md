This repository contains the code associated with the paper:

ðŸš€ Improving Control Smoothness in Unmanned Surface Vehicle Path-Following: A Fourier-Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach in the Presence of Observation Noises

Authors: Zhuxin Zhang et al.

Paper: Codes will be available upon acceptance of the manuscript.

Key Information:

This repository supports the research on the Parameter-Trainable Fourier Filter (PTFF) approach, which integrates frequency-domain filtering with deep reinforcement learning to enhance control smoothness and path-following accuracy of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) under noisy conditions.

Stay tuned for updates once the paper is accepted!
